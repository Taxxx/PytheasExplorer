#Pytheas Explorer
        Pytheas Explorer consists of exploration tools, using technologies 
        for image analysis with structure sensor (http://structure.io/) and 
        enhanced exploration with virtual reality. This app is not only for 
        mining objectives but also it is a tool for education and space tourism.
